# Team_Titans_Airline-On-Time-Performance-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the on-time performance of various airlines using delay data. It provides insights into departure and arrival delays, identifies trends, and visualizes performance across airlines.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze average departure and arrival delays.
- Identify the airline with the most delays.
- Visualize delay trends and correlations between departure and arrival delays.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is hypothetical and stored in a CSV file (`airline_performance.csv`). The data includes:
- **Columns**:
  - `Month`: Month of the flight.
  - `Day`: Day of the flight.
  - `Airline`: Name of the airline.
  - `FlightNumber`: Unique flight identifier.
  - `DepartureDelay`: Departure delay in minutes (negative values indicate early departures).
  - `ArrivalDelay`: Arrival delay in minutes (negative values indicate early arrivals).
